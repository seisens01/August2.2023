Plots and descriptive statistics for NHANES data on self-reported drug use in men and women, age 18-65 years, from 2011-2018

The purpose of this project is to apply lessons learned about dplyr and ggplot2 from the DataCamp Interactive Courses, "Introduction to the Tidyverse" and "Data Manipulation with dplyr", taught online by David Robinson and other data science experts, to explore a dataset containing real data. The R dplyr package allows one to manipulate data in R by filtering, sorting, and summarizing a dataset and the ggplot2 package allows for visualization of data with various types of plots. I completed the courses in July and August 2023.

I am interested in being a public health data analyst, with special interest in substance use and psychiatric disorders. I chose to retrieve demographic and questionnaire data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; see citation at end of document) website containing public use data files. The NHANES is a set of studies used to assess health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The NHANES survey has been a continuous program since 1999, examining a nationally representative sample of ~5000 people per year.

For the current project, I focused on adults 18+ years, from cross-sectional cohorts assessed at 4 different time points (2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2015-2016, 2017-2018). Demographic ("Demographic Variables and Sample Weights" data file) and questionnaire ("Drug Use" data file) data were retrieved using the "nhanesA" package. I used R Studio for manipulation and visualization with dplyr and ggplot2 tools, respectively. As I continue my journey in learning hot to use R in data analytics, I will continue to update this repository and improve the plot aesthetics. So stay tuned!

**Main takeaways**: The most interesting results shown in this project so far are the following: 1) Part 4A: Overwhelmingly, more men than women report ever having used marijuana or other substances. About half of the respondents reported ever trying marijuana while uner 20% of respondents reported ever trying the other substances studied. 2) Part 4B: Relative to women, men tended to report more frequent use of most substances over the past month. There were different patterns for frequency of use during the past month across different substances: marijuana use frequency varied but also had a bimodal distribution in which most respondents reported using it very few days or nearly every day. Cocaine on average was used only for a few days during the past month, whereas heroin and methamphetamine frequency of use were more variable. Men tended to report slightly greater frequency of use of most substances than women. Older individuals (ages 20-39) were much more likely to report past month frequency of use of the substances studied than individuals under 20 years old. Older individuals, especially 40-59 year olds, who were experiencing greater poverty levels tended to report more frequent use of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine during the past month compared to individuals with higher income:family size ratios. 3) Part 4C: Average age at first use of marijuana was under 20 years old across genders and age groups while, for other substances studied, the average age of first use was lower 20's. Men tended to report younger age at first trying substances than women. Many participants in older age groups (20-59) tended to report older ages at first trying the substances studied, including in their 30s, 40s and 50s. This tendency was marked in individuals with lower income:family size ratios. It is beyond the scope of this project, at its current stage, to assess within-subject patterns (i.e. are the same individuals who report more frequent use of cocaine likely to be the same as those who report more frequent use of other substances?). I do plan to answer this question in the future. 

**Important disclosures/caveats:** As the current project is for demonstration of R tidyverse methods of manipulating and visualizing data only, no statistical analyses are performed. Therefore, the inferences reported here are based on what is visible in the tables and plots. Descriptive statistics and plots are for demonstration of tool use only. **In this update, sample data is now appropriately weighted and therefore represents the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/analyticguidelines/11-16-analytic-guidelines.pdf). This repository is not a guide to using R but rather reflects my learning how to apply tidyverse concepts to real data concerning substance use patterns in the U.S.
